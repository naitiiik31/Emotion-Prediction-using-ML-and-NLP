# Emotion-Prediction-using-ML-and-NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is based on Emotion Prediction from text using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It takes text input and predicts the emotion expressed in the sentence.

The project is created for academic and learning purposes and helps understand how NLP and ML work together.
